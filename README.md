# docdoctors
This is the project we will use for the Modernization of our documentation. 
There are three phases:
  1. Colorization for Code examples
  2. Runnable Code Examples
  3. Overall presentation

     
Number 1 has already been implemented using a widget that supports the same colorization as the ECL IDE and Vs Code editors.
Number 2 has been developed, but is not quite ready
Number 3 has been designed and needs to be implemented into the build process (using XSLT and CSS )
