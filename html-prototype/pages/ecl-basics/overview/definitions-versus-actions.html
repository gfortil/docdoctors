        Functionally, there are two types of ECL code: Definitions (AKA Attribute definitions) and executable Actions. Actions
        are not valid for use in expressions because they do not return values. Most ECL code is composed of definitions.
        <br /><br />
        Definitions only define what is to be done, they do not actually execute. This means that the ECL programmer should
        think in terms of writing code that specifies what to do rather than how to do it. This is an important concept in that,
        the programmer is telling the supercomputer what needs to happen and not directing how it must be accomplished. This
        frees the super-computer to optimize the actual execution in any way it needs to produce the desired result.
        <br /><br />
        A second consideration is: the order that Definitions appear in source code does not define their execution order--ECL
        is a non-procedural language. When an Action (such as OUTPUT) executes, all the Definitions it needs to use (drilling
        down to the lowest level Definitions upon which others are built) are compiled and optimized--in other words, unlike
        other programming languages, there is no inherent execution order implicit in the order that definitions appear in
        source code (although there is a necessary order for compilation to occur without error--forward references are not
        allowed). This concept of "orderless execution" requires a different mindset from standard, order-dependent programming
        languages because it makes the code appear to execute "all at once."
